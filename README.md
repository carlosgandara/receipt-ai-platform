🔐 Python Flask JWT Authentication with Refresh Token Rotation

Enterprise-grade, production-ready authentication system built with Flask. Features HttpOnly cookies, refresh token rotation, silent frontend recovery, and Neon PostgreSQL.

✨ Features

🔐 Register with email + password (bcrypt hashed)

📧 Email verification (expires in 24h)

🍪 HttpOnly Cookies – Tokens are invisible to JavaScript (XSS-safe)

🔑 JWT Access Token (short-lived, stored in HttpOnly cookie)

🔄 Refresh Token Rotation – Long-lived, hashed in DB, invalidated on use (replay attack proof)

🛡️ Silent Token Refresh – Frontend catches 401s, calls /refresh automatically, and retries requests

📊 Protected Pages – /dashboard and /profile with cookie-based auth

🚪 Secure Logout – Revokes refresh token in DB and deletes cookies

🔁 Logout All Devices – Revokes all active sessions with one click

🔐 Change Password – Users can update their password (logs out all devices)

🩺 Health Check – /health endpoint for load balancers and monitoring

📨 Password Reset (expires in 15min)

🖥️ Web UI – AJAX forms with automatic redirects

🐘 PostgreSQL Database – Managed via Neon (serverless, scalable, auto-backup)

⏱️ Rate Limiting – Per-IP and per-IP+User combo protection

🛡️ Strict CSP – No inline scripts/styles (XSS protection)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: 🐍 Flask (Python 3.10+)

Auth: 🔐 PyJWT + bcrypt

Cookies: 🍪 HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax

Database: 🐘 PostgreSQL via Neon (serverless) with SQLAlchemy ORM

Email: ✉️ SMTP (Brevo / Sendinblue / Gmail)

Frontend: 🌐 HTML + vanilla JS (combined in static files)

Security Headers: 🛡️ Flask-Talisman (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

🚀 Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/carlosgandara/python-flask-jwt-auth.git
   cd python-flask-jwt-auth

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Create a .env file (see example below):
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp-relay.brevo.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=your-smtp-username
   EMAIL_PASS=your-smtp-password
   EMAIL_FROM=your-email@example.com
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-very-long-secret-min-32-chars
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database
   COOKIE_SECURE=False  # Set to True in production with HTTPS

5. Run the app:
   python app.py

6. Open your browser:
   Visit http://localhost:5000/login

Note: .env is ignored by Git – your secrets stay safe.

🌐 API Endpoints

POST /register – Create user + send verification email (No auth required)
GET /verify-email – Verify email with token (No auth required)
POST /login – Set access_token and refresh_token as HttpOnly cookies (No auth required)
POST /refresh – Rotate tokens (issue new Access + Refresh) (Refresh Cookie required)
GET /protected – Test route – returns user email (Access Cookie required)
GET /dashboard – Protected HTML page (Access Cookie required)
GET /profile – Protected HTML page (Access Cookie required)
POST /logout – Revoke refresh token + delete cookies (Access Cookie required)
POST /logout-all – Revoke ALL active refresh tokens (Access Cookie required)
POST /change-password – Update password (logs out all devices) (Access Cookie required)
POST /forgot-password – Request password reset link (No auth required)
POST /reset-password – Reset password with token (No auth required)
GET /health – Health check for load balancers (No auth required)

🧪 Testing with curl (Windows CMD)

Important: The new flow uses HttpOnly cookies. Use -c to save cookies and -b to send them.

1. Register:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"password\":\"StrongP@ssw0rd!\"}"

2. Login (saves cookies to cookies.txt):
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"password\":\"StrongP@ssw0rd!\"}" -c cookies.txt -i

3. Access protected endpoint (uses saved cookie):
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/protected -b cookies.txt

4. Refresh tokens (rotation – kills old token):
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/refresh -b cookies.txt -c cookies_new.txt -i

5. Prove rotation works (reuse old token – fails):
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/refresh -b cookies.txt
   Expected: {"error": "Invalid or expired refresh token"} (replay attack blocked)

6. Logout single device:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/logout -b cookies_new.txt -i

7. Logout all devices:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/logout-all -b cookies_new.txt -i

8. Health check:
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/health

👨‍💻 Web UI Walkthrough

📝 Register – Fill in email/password → receive verification email.
✅ Verify – Click the link in your email.
🔑 Login – Enter credentials → automatically redirected to /dashboard.
📊 Dashboard – Shows your protected user data. Click "Refresh Data" to test the API.
👤 Profile – Another protected page (demonstrates cookie persistence).
🔄 Silent Refresh – If you wait for the Access Token to expire (e.g., 1 min) and click "Refresh Data", the frontend silently calls /refresh and retries – you never see a login screen.
🚪 Logout – Clears cookies and revokes the refresh token in the database.
🔁 Logout All – Revokes all active sessions (great for lost devices).
🔐 Change Password – Update your password; all devices are logged out automatically.

✉️ Email Configuration

Works with any SMTP provider:
- Brevo (Sendinblue) – Recommended (free tier)
- Gmail – Use an App Password
- SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.

🐘 Neon PostgreSQL Setup

1. Sign up for Neon at https://neon.tech
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your connection string:
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database
4. Add it to your .env file

🛡️ Security Highlights

Password storage: bcrypt (12 rounds)
JWT signing: HMAC-SHA256 with secret key
Refresh tokens: Dual-hash strategy (SHA256 for index + bcrypt for verification)
Refresh token rotation: Old tokens revoked on each refresh (replay attack proof)
Multi-device support: Each login creates a separate refresh token row
Cookies: HttpOnly (XSS-safe), Secure (HTTPS-only), SameSite=Lax (CSRF protection)
CSP: Strict policy – no inline scripts/styles (XSS protection)
Rate limiting: Per-IP and per-IP+User combo (in-memory for development)
Verification tokens: Plain storage (can be upgraded to hashed)

🚀 Future Improvements

- Add Redis for rate limiting (production ready)
- Hashed verification tokens
- Unit tests
- Admin panel
- OAuth2 / OIDC support
- Social login (Google, GitHub)
